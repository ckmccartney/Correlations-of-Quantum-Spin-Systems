This Github contains the Matlab File for the creation of Figures in my Part III Essay - Correlations of Quantum Spin Systems. 
By running the Matlab file as it is, Figures 4-6 from the paper will be generated, and it is also easy to change the variables for N (the number of lattice sites) and gamma(2\beta J) (which implicitly changes the value of \beta)
to check that the calculated exponential bounds hold as they should.
